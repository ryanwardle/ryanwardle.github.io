      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <div class="description">
        <p>In 2013 architect Arthur Van Delay was drinking his morning cup of coffee. The coffee was expensive but the taste
           left much to be desired. He began to wonder about where the coffee came from and if it was possible to get better quality coffee,
           at a more reasonable price. Arthur started to ask himself questions. Was the price of the coffee justified?
          Was the price worth it? Was it possible to get a better cup of coffee for a better price? No, no, and yes!
        Arthur soon quit his job as an architect to start Van Delay coffee. The reason we are able to sell
      coffee to consumers at such a low price is because we buy our product directly from some of the best coffee
    farmers in the entire world, effectively making us a wholesaler. Instead of buying expensive coffee from a store
    who has greatly marked up the price, you are able to buy small batches of coffee directly from us at wholesale prices.</p>

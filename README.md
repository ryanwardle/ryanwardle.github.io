# Portfolio Website

## Goals for Website
1. Build a responsive website.
2. Build using a mobile first approach.
3. Implement the use animations.

### Problems I encountered and how I solved them
1. Having trouble with the design aspects, mostly choice of colors. Trying to find which
 colors or effects I think will best help my website "pop". I have gone through several color
 palettes, but they all seem too dull.

## Problems I encountered and how I fixed them

When I installed npm, it installed node_modules. I later needed to ignore these files,
but they were already committed. So, I had to remove the cached files and then ignore the
node_modules files, next I committed the files left.

Google Chrome is not properly displaying SVG's, currently working on a solution.
